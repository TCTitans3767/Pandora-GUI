Basic idea:

- Left side: Tree of buttons/folders(groups) with drag and drop support as well as name editing. Selecting one should bring that button's properties on the right side as well as highlight it on the button box preview.
- Right side: Properties of the selected button/folder(group) with options to change color, icon, name, action, etc.
- Middle: Preview of the button box with drag and drop support to rearrange buttons/folders(groups) and button's location editing.
- Top: Menu bar with options to create new button box, open existing one, save current one, push current one, and settings.
- Bottom: Status bar for serial connection and such
